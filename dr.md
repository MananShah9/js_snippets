Going forward, we'll be testing updates on a few dummy servers before rolling them out widely. This should catch potential problems early and save us from headaches later.
Cure:

Empowering ITSO: We should enable ITSO to handle critical tasks, like re-pointing to DR environments and system reboots. This way, we won't be stuck waiting for the support team.
Automated Snapshots: Let's set up daily automated snapshots of the OS drive. If something goes wrong, we can quickly roll back to a previous state, just like in public cloud setups.
Flexible Volume Mounting: It would be great if we could mount the OS drive to another working system as a new volume, make necessary changes, and re-point to the original VM. This approach is straightforward and effective, much like solutions offered by public cloud providers.
