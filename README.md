Our Journey Migrating Dashboards to the DHP Cloud (Part 2 of 2)

Introduction:
After successfully migrating our first dashboard to the DHP Cloud and reaping the benefits, our team was ready to take the next big stepâ€”getting our own domain and setting up our Cranker router. This part of our journey would further streamline our DevOps processes and enhance our application's accessibility.

The Next Phase:
With the initial POC behind us, we were excited to embark on a new challenge. The goal was clear: establish our own domain and onboard our Cranker router, a critical piece of the DHP ecosystem that would allow us to manage our applications more efficiently.

Smooth Onboarding Thanks to Expert Guidance:
Thanks to Robert Dann's expertise in Cranker as a service, our transition was smoother than expected. We were the first team to onboard using this new setup, and the process was straightforward:

Repository Setup: We started by creating a stash repo in the RPP project with our project name.
Cranker Router Deployment: Next, we configured and deployed a Cranker router using environmental variables in Relto, simplifying the connection to our applications.
Domain Registration: We then registered a new domain with a CNAME record pointing to our MSS domain, ensuring seamless connectivity.
Security Measures: The setup included an SSL certificate, bolstering our platform's security.
UAT and Beyond:
While we have only tested this setup in UAT, the production phase is well underway. For those curious about how to connect an app to this new Cranker router, we have provided a helpful GitHub project.
