*1 app only approach because teammates may “copy” my code and get same benefits to team across more apps while I focus on other development areas.

Objective: Mode 2

Cloud certification

Act as a bridge for helping develop new data ecosystem
Bet:
Delivering a best-in-class Metrics platform for analytics
Curating a trusted data ecosystem for DevOps metrics
Building Innovation through experiments

Develop reusable services - Rationalizing our products, Building Innovation through experiments
Like:
Commentary system
SQL to excel/table on dashboard
SQL to PPT?



Objective: Streamline SDLC for enhanced efficiency
Rationale: Create automations for app deployment and testing creating a safer controls first approach for our apps.
BET: Maturing our services, curating a trusted data ecosystem for DevOps metrics, Reducing TOIL 
Key Results:
As long as the code is reusable for at least 1 app I should 
•	Implement automated deployment pipeline for at least 1 app which can be reused.
•	Implement automated data quality checks at critical pipeline stages
•	Identify and refactor three of the most inefficient SDLC processes

Objective: Drive scalability and reusability of solutions
Rationale: Maximize the impact and reduce technical debt of development efforts. This reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) of analytics and insights by optimizing cloud resource utilization and implementing cost-saving measures.
Bet: Building Innovation through experiments, Building DevOps Communities, Doubling down on DevOps Insights and partnerships Reducing TCO 

Key Results:
Onboard DHP/social with atleast 1 application and share the journey with DevOps services.
This may include reusing database service, SSO, Logging, resiliency,scaling, secrets managements,etc from DHP
Increase awareness and adoption of existing tools like DHP by blogging/sharing our experience and helping others.
